# Overview
This application is a foundational project created to explore and understand the core concepts of SwiftUI. It serves as a stepping stone for developing modern iOS applications using SwiftUIâ€™s declarative UI framework.

The app is intentionally kept simple to focus on the essentials of SwiftUI, making it an ideal starting point for:

- Understanding SwiftUI components and their functionalities.
- Learning how to customize views to create visually appealing interfaces.
- Implementing the MVVM architectural pattern to organize code effectively.
- Exploring additional SwiftUI features, such as animations, navigation, and state management.

The app is still a work in progress.
